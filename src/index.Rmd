# About

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Origins

This book originated when a group of students expressed interest in a licensing class.

## Philosophy 

Most hams agree that getting their "ticket" or license was the start of the journey, not the destination.
In fact, for many hams, much of the material that must be mastered to pass one of the licensing exams only really makes sense in the specific context of operating.
So, our philosophy with this book is to emphasize operating practices, and especially *listening*.

In the U.S., you don't need a license to listen, and even if you are an active operator, you'll spend most of your time listening. 
Many hams started out as shortwave listeners (SWLs) back when the airwaves were full of shortwave stations that broadcasted programs in the ham bands or adjacent to ham bands.
And listening to other hams operate is one of the best ways to learn what to do, and sometimes, what not to do.
