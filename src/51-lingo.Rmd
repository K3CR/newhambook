# Lingo

Ham radio is no different than any other human activity: There's a bunch of specialized lingo.
Actually, ham radio may have more lingo, jargon, and acronyms than most hobbies.
But fear not.
Learning to talk the talk is part of what makes joining a new community fun.
And with ham radio, communicating (in one form or another) is the main point.
As an international hobby with a 100+ year history, learning how to 'speak ham' is one of the best ways to join our community.

By the way, it is ham radio not HAM radio.
Ham is not an abbreviation for something.
Also, some new folks might say, "I'm interested in ham; or I'm thinking about getting into HAM."
That sounds like they are interested in an edible pork product, not our glorious hobby.
Most hams are forgiving people who want newcomers to join our ranks.
But saying certain things is like writing a scarlet H in the middle of your forehead.

## Phonetic alphabet {- #phonetic-alphabet}

Amateurs across the globe have agreed on a standard phonetic alphabet--a way of spelling out callsigns and words that makes them more easily understood when propagation might not be ideal.

The phonetic alphabet is often used on HF, but rarely on VHF or UHF FM.
That's because signals on VHF or UHF FM are often heard through repeaters and are usually *very* readable.
So, if you're transmitting on VHF or UHF through a repeater, you don't need to use the phonetic alphabet.

Some hams use different phonetic equivalents from the ones below, like "Wacko Three Tiny Microphone" for W3TM.
As a rule of thumb, it's better practice and the more common custom to use the standard phonetic alphabet.
Sometimes under difficult operating conditions, like a busy contest, you might say "Whiskey Three TEXAS MASSACHUSETTS" or something unusual rather than "Whiskey Three Tango Mike"--*if* the other operator can't quite copy the last part of your callsign after you've tried the standard phonetics several times.

| Letter | Phonetic equivalent |
