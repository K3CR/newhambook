## Don't buy a radio (yet)

Many prospective hams buy a radio before they have a license.

We suggest that you wait just a bit before buying a radio.

Why? Well the often irresistible temptation is to buy the least expensive radio. Some inexpensive radios work well; others do not.

By learning a bit more about ham radio, meeting other hams, and discussing the pros and cons of different radios, your decision to buy a radio can be a better-informed one.
You might even find that a current ham is happy to let you borrow a radio while you learn and may even sell it to you at a very reasonable price.

On the other hand, if you just can't hold back, we recommend not spending a whole lot of money.

It's an open secret that hams realize early on is that radios have a way of asking for company.
In other words, your first radio is unlikely to be your last or your only.
