[["index.html", "A ham: What I am Chapter 1 About Origins Philosophy", " A ham: What I am Rick Gilmore W3TM 2023-04-13 Chapter 1 About This book is about amateur (ham) radio, a hobby that is both old school and new cool. It’s designed to live on the web so that we can make use of the fabulous resources that exist online. It’s also designed to supplement but not replace an existing outstanding set of materials for learning about the hobby. Origins This book originated when a group of Penn State students expressed interest in a licensing class. In starting with the Technician question pool provided by HamStudy.org Rick Gilmore W3TM realized just how much there is to explain! So, he started jotting down ideas about how to make the process easier in a web-book form that he uses in his teaching at Penn State and in his research. Philosophy Most hams agree that getting their “ticket” or license was the start of the journey, not the destination. In fact, for many hams, much of the material that must be mastered to pass one of the licensing exams only really makes sense in the specific context of operating or doing something related to operating. So, our philosophy with this book is to emphasize hands-on activities, operating practices, and especially listening. Other hams may have other ideas about the right approach. We think that there are many good ways to go forward, and this one particularly appeals to us. In the U.S., you don’t need a license to listen, and even if you are an active operator, you’ll spend most of your time listening. Many hams started out as shortwave listeners (SWLs) back when the airwaves were full of shortwave stations that broadcasted programs in the ham bands or adjacent to ham bands. And listening to other hams operate is one of the best ways to learn what to do, and sometimes, what not to do. "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 2 Getting started Get licensed Don’t buy a radio (just yet)", " Chapter 2 Getting started Get licensed Unless you shun technology, you probably use multiple radios every day and don’t even think about it. You might listen to music or news on FM or music or talk on AM. Obviously, that’s radio. You might watch TV from an over-the-air antenna to avoid or reduce your cable TV bill. TV uses radio waves. So, that’s radio. Your home or work computer might use wifi to talk to the internet. That’s radio. Your cellphone (smart or dumb) talks to a network of cell towers wherever you go. That’s radio. You might connect headphones, a keyboard, or a mouse to your computer using Bluetooth. That’s radio. You might have a GPS system in your car or a handheld one when you hike or bike. That’s radio. You might use a device in your car to open your garage. That’s radio. Besides the radio technology that underlies all of these devices, there is a system of rules and regulations written and enforced by (in the U.S.) the Federal government, specifically, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The rules govern who can transmit what types of radio signals at what frequencies and at what power levels, among other things. Most Americans hate rules and regulations and the “red tape” that comes with them. On the other hand, many of our most beloved leisure activities would be completely different without rules and regulations. Imagine football, baseball, basketball, or fill-in-your-favorite-sport here without some sort of rules. And while players can sometimes enforce the rules themselves, it’s usually better for everyone if that job is left to referees. However annoying they can sometimes be, rules provide structure. And that structure often, maybe more often than some of us like to admit, makes an activity more enjoyable. Rules about who can do what where with radio have the same impact. So, while you can use lots of different radios without a license, to transmit signals on the amateur radio bands requires a license. Radio amateurs have specific segments of the radio spectrum that are set aside for our use and enjoyment, often our exclusive use. Think about that. And in return for setting aside valuable parts of the radio frequency spectrum, the FCC requires us to have a license. Think of it as a driver’s license, a license to drive our radios. So, while listening is free, transmitting will cost you $35 (the current licensing fee), plus the time it takes you to study for and pass the licensing exam. There’s more to being a radio amateur than passing a licensing exam, just like there’s much more to driving than passing the written test. But you have to have a license for the “behind the wheel” part of driving your radio. This book and website is designed to help you do just that. Study resources There are outstanding licensing materials provided by others. Here are some we especially recommend. American Radio Relay League ([ARRL]) HamStudy.org. The site has integrated iOS and Android apps so you can study on-the-go. (Web site: Free; Apps: paid). Ham Radio Prep. Full licensing courses and test preparation materials. (Paid). Technician licensing videos by Ham Radio Crash Course, Course (n.d.) Don’t buy a radio (just yet) Many prospective hams buy a radio before they have a license. We suggest that you wait just a bit before buying a radio. Why? Well the often irresistible temptation is to buy the least expensive radio. Some inexpensive radios work well; others do not. By learning a bit more about ham radio, meeting other hams, and discussing the pros and cons of different radios, your decision to buy a radio can be a better-informed one. You might even find that a current ham is happy to let you borrow a radio while you learn and may even sell it to you at a very reasonable price. On the other hand, if you just can’t hold back, we recommend not spending a whole lot of money. It’s an open secret that hams realize early on: Radios have a way of asking for company. In other words, your first radio is unlikely to be your last or your only.

In this quest, we’ll check-in on the bands and listen to some HF [QSO]s. Here are some other web-based SDRs you might try: http://kiwisdr.com/public/ http://www.maghull-scene.co.uk/radio.htm Vist the WebSDR site at https://websdr.org. You will see a screen like the following: Scroll down to see all of the places around the world where there are webSDR stations to listen to. You can pick any one you like, but we’ll focus on one in the U.S. that we use often because it’s close to our location. Visit the K3FEF web SDR Go to http://websdr.k3fef.com. This station is located in Milford, PA on the Delaware River. It’s the closest one to Penn State. So, it’s often one to consult for listeners in our area. Here is a screenshot of the K3FEF control panel. (#fig:k3fef.com)K3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com The dark blue area at the top depicts the band activity at the time you visit. The figure shows radio signals being heard by K3FEF from about 3300 kHz (3.3 MHz) below the 80m ham band to 5300 kHz (5.5 MHz) in the 60m ham band. If you are watching this on the web, you will see upwards motion. This is how the webSDR depicts the time series or history of recent signals. So, time is on the vertical axis of this two-dimensional figure. Sometimes this type of frequency-over-time display is called a waterfall. Except this waterfall falls upward. Below the figure are some orange ‘flag’ or labels that other listeners have added. These identify the specific transmissions. If you look especially closely, you’ll also see a yellow ‘hump’ around 3875 kHz. That’s the specific frequency this SDR defaulted to when we opened it up. We’ll explain what the yellow hump means a bit later. In the static figure above, you’ll notice a lot of activity between about 3550 kHz and 4000 kHz. The 80m and 75m ham bands occupy 3500-4000 kHz, so those are hams communicating. The figure was taken about 8:00am EDT (1200 UTC). These bands are usually open from evening to mid-morning. Let’s focus on the white panel below the waterfall. Figure 3.1: K3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com The panel’s Frequency control tells us that our radio is tuned to 3875 MHz, right in the middle of the 80/75m band, the phone (voice) portion. There are some controls to change the frequency, then below that, a set of buttons to change the band. The highlighted button confirms that we are in the 80/75m band1. Notice that the K3FEF webSDR covers ham bands up through 6m. It does not cover the 15m or 12m bands, though. Below the Frequency control is a set of buttons that control Bandwidth. No, bandwidth is not the size of your favorite jazz combo. Bandwidth means how much of the frequency spectrum the webSDR is capturing at this moment, centered on the 3875 kHz frequency we just mentioned. Different types of radio transmissions (voice vs. Morse code/CW for example) have different bandwidths. We often want to adjust our bandwidth to match the type of signal. If the bandwidth is much wider than the signal, we’re just adding noise. If the bandwidth is much narrower than the signal, we can lose information. Voice transmissions have wider bandwidth than Morse code/CW. And different types of voice signals have different bandwidths. FM is the widest, for example; AM is in the middle; and single sideband SSB the narrowest. Our bandwidth is 9.69 kHz @ -6 dB 2. That’s wide, except for broadcast FM stations. We can adjust the bandwidth incrementally using the wider/narrower buttons or adjust the bandwidth to match a specific type of signal: CW-wide/CW-nrw (narrow), LSB-wide/LSB-nrw, USB-wide/USB-nrw, AM-wide/AM-nrw, and FM. We can also adjust the bandwidth manually. 3.0.0.1 Find a signal to listen to Click on the green Firefox audio start button in the upper right hand of the screen. Be ready to adjust the volume on your computer downward! Or adjust the volume in the panel or even mute it (see the figure below). Chances are that you’ll just hear static since we’re on a random frequency. Figure 3.2: K3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com To fix that, look at the Waterfall view panel. Zoom in by clicking on the button a couple of times. Sometimes zooming moves window beyond the frequency where you are currently tuned. If that happens, you won’t see the yellow ‘hump’ anymore. But you can find it again by clicking on the blue/purple area in the waterfall and dragging to the left or the right to put your current frequency–3875 kHz for our example–in the middle of the panel. In our case, there’s a very strong signal around 3810 kHz. Figure 3.3: K3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com Quest 2: DMR These activities are relevant to the following license pool questions: T2B12; T4B07; T8D02; T8D07. You can listen to Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) transmissions across the globe on the web without having to log in or have a ham radio license. In this quest, we’ll listen in on some conversations using DMR. Remember, as a ham, all of our communications except those controlling aircraft or satellites are presumed public. Visit the Brandmeister Network server’s hoseline site. You will see something like the following: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;include/img/brandmeister-hoseline-2023-04-03.png&quot;) Figure 3.4: Brandmeister DMR hoseline as of 2023-04-03 about 1745Z This shows all of the stations connected to the Brandmeister network in the entire world. To listen in on one of these [QSO]s, click on an active QSO. Active QSOs will be outlined in red. You can also listen in on specific talkgroups. A talkgroup is like a repeater, except that it repeats signals from stations connected via the internet. There is often traffic on talkgroup 91 (Worldwide) or talkgroup 93 (North America), so let’s listen in on those. Click the PLAYER button in the upper right hand corner. This will open a small panel where you can select what talkgroups to listen to or which stations to monitor. Figure 3.5: PLAYER panel from hose.brandmeister.network Quest 3: APRS In this quest, we’ll check-in on the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) where hams across the world provide real-time information about their locations and exchange messages, including weather reports. Visit the APRS.fi website. The first time you visit this site, it may show you a view of APRS activity near the APRS.fi website author’s home in Finland (hence the .fi web domain). Feel free to scroll out using the minus (-) button in the lower right hand corner and then click and drag to another location. For example, here is a view near Philadelphia, PA. Figure 3.6: APRS activity near Philadelphia, PA on 2023-04-05 Notice that some of the symbols look like vehicles and have a track that appears to show where they’ve been. Mouse over one of those symbols. You should see a set of lines connecting the vehicle symbol to another one on the map. The lines show where the RF signal from the vehicle traveled before being heard and sent over the Internet to the APRS.fi site. Figure 3.7: APRS track of moving vehicle K2WB-9. The figure shows the station K2WB connecting to a home-based relay station N2IVN and the relayed signal from N2IVN being heard by KD2DVW-1. Click on the mobile (moving) station’s icon. A small window will open with information about that station. Click on the info button in the small window. Enter ISS in the “Track callsign:” window in the upper right of the aprs.fi site. The International Space Station has an APRS beacon! So, if you have an APRS-enabled radio set up you can hear the ISS when it passes near your location. I did this on the morning of 2023-04-05, and here was the result. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;include/img/aprs-iss-2023-04-05.png&quot;) The ISS was somewhere over the North Atlantic Ocean. I say was, because if you look closely, you’ll see that the last time the ISS was heard on APRS was on 2023-04-04, about 20 hours before the time I took this screenshot. The APRS beacon goes on and off from time to time. Quest 4: Satellite tracking Hams have launched satellites that permit communication across large areas, and the International Space Station (ISS) has ham radio equipment on board. Visit https://www.n2yo.com/space-station/ The window in the upper left will show a map of the current location of the ISS. The window in the upper right will show the current live video feed from the ISS. If it’s dark, that’s probably because the ISS is on the night side of the Earth. Visit the Amateur Satellite Corporation (AMSAT) tracking site. Here you can choose to track a number of amateur satellites. The site will calculate the next time a satellite will pass over your location. You need to give it your latitude and longitude or your grid square for this to work. What’s a grid square? Well every part of the Earth has been assigned a code that is a combination of letters and numbers. The codes are part of the Maidenhead Locator System.

The site gives you both your latitude and longitude and grid square. The figure below shows my approximate location and grid square, FN10. Notice that grid squares can be increasingly precise. For our purposes now, the four character grid square is sufficient. Hams who operate digital modes like FT8 and FT4 using the WSJT-X software use grid squares, too. And some hams “collect” contacts in different grid squares. For now, we’ll use our grid square to calculate when the ISS will pass over our grid square. Enter your grid square in the AMSAT Tracking site. Hit “Calculate Position” to let the site calculate your latitude and longitude, then hit the “Predict” button. The results show the next several passes of the ISS over my grid square. Yours will be different, even if you live in my grid square, because the ISS is always moving. Quest 5: POTA/SOTA hunting In this quest, you will “hunt” hams who are operating using portable stations from one of several thousand parks around the world as part of the Parks on the Air (POTA) system. 3.0.1 Visit Pota.app knitr::include_url(&quot;https://pota.app/&quot;) Figure 3.8: Current Parks on the Air (POTA) from https://pota.app The site shows hams who are active on the air right now and on what frequencies and using which modes. 3.0.2 Choose a station to “hunt” By hunt, of course, we mean try to hear on the radio. Once you’re licensed with appropriate privileges, you can try to make contact. For now, let’s just try to hear the station. You have some decisions to make. Which mode, CW, FT8, or phone? Which band? Unless you have already set up a receiver to copy and decode FT8, you can eliminate stations using [FT8] or [FT4]. Phone is the easiest, but also requires the best band conditions. Here are some rules of thumb to guide your choices: The lower frequency (higher wavelength) bands (160m, 80m/75m, 60m, and 40m) propagate longer distances at night than during the day. During the early morning hours, 80m/75m might support regional propagation, meaning you can hear stations within several hundred miles of your location. 60m and 40m might also work for regional communication throughout the day. The higher bands (30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, and 10m) are long distance (DX) bands and are most active during the day and under good solar conditions. Once you’ve chosen a station to hunt, you can try to hear them on a WebSDR. 3.0.3 Open WebSDR If you pick a WebSDR near your location, then you’ll need to consider the rules of thumb above. If you pick a WebSDR somewhere else, you’ll have to think like a ham in one of those locations: What bands are open to hams and to what parts of the world from that location? 3.0.4 Tune to the POTA station frequency If the station is still active on the frequency and propagation to the WebSDR location is good, you should see a signal in the waterfall. Try to copy the station? Can you hear the callsign? Can you hear any stations trying to call. Quest 6: [FT8]/FT4 digital modes https://wsjtx.groups.io/g/main/topic/websdr_for_wsjtx/79502964 Why is it called the 80m band and also the 75m band and sometimes the 80m/75m band? Well, 300/3.5=85.7142857 and 300/4.0=75. So, the approximate speed of light (in millions of meters per second) divided by the frequency in MHz gives us the approximate wavelength of radio waves. It’s a single 0.5 MHz (500 kHz) chunk of frequency reserved exclusively for amateurs that roughly bracket ~80-75m.↩︎ This means that if we look at the peak signal at 3875 kHz and calculate the point on both sides of 3875 kHz where the signal drops by 6 decibels (db) or about 4-fold, we’re left with 9.69 kHz of signal. The width of the yellow ‘hump’ in the waterfall display shows us this bandwidth visually.↩︎ "],["band-conditions.html", "Chapter 4 Band conditions HF propagation VHF propagation PSK Reporter WSPR Rocks", " Chapter 4 Band conditions Hams with HF privileges like to check in on band conditions from time to time since the conditions change regularly just like the weather. The main things to check are what bands are open to what places. The band or frequencies we can use to communicate with different places vary by time of day, time of year, current and long-term solar conditions. Here are some resources to see how the bands are doing. HF propagation The hfpropagation.com site has some great visualizations about conditions on HF. For example, the following shows a map of RF propagation centered on New York City: Figure 4.1: Propagation map centered on NYC on 2023-04-02 from https://www.hfpropagation.com VHF propagation See https://vhf.dxview.org PSK Reporter The pskreporter.info site aggregates thousands of signal reports from hams all around the world.

"],["fm-repeaters.html", "Chapter 5 FM repeaters Background Equipment Tips and Tricks", " Chapter 5 FM repeaters Background Repeaters are special transceivers that receive on one frequency (the input) and automatically re-transmit the received signal on another output frequency. The retransmitted signal is often sent with higher power, from an antenna with good gain, and from a high-up location that has many line-of-sight paths to surrounding locations. Equipment HTs A handi-talkie or HT is often a new ham’s first radio transceiver. HTs can be operated by hand, with usually a single press of the thumb on the PTT button to transmit. Most HTs today are FM-only devices even though the original HTs invented for use in World War II were AM transceivers. Most HTs operate at 4-5W and are perfect for short-distance communication with repeaters or directly with other hams. Some HTs operate on a single band, most often 2m. But reasonably affordable dual-band HTs that operate on 2m and 70cm are also popular. A small number of HTs are multi-band, supporting communication on 2m, 1.25m, and 70cm, for example. HTs usually come with a short, flexible “rubber duck” antenna that works reasonably well outside. But these “ducky” antennas are not especially efficient nor work well inside a vehicle or building. T9A04; T9A07. Some HTs can even communicate with the APRS network. See the APRS Quest for an APRS-related activity and the section on APRS in the chapter on digital mode operations. Mobile rigs A mobile radio offers higher transmit power (50W or more), a bigger screen, and other useful features. These radios can be mounted in a vehicle or used indoors. In both cases, the radios must be connected via coax to a suitable antenna that is matched to the band or bands of operation. Single band (2m or 70cm) and dual band (2m and 70cm) radios are common. Tips and Tricks "],["digital-modes.html", "Chapter 6 Digital modes Background Modes Equipment Tips and tricks", " Chapter 6 Digital modes Background Digital modes involve computer-to-computer communication with radio somewhere in the middle. The advent of new digital modes that permit DX communication in weak signal conditions has revolutionized the use of digital modes of communication. They are one of the most active areas in ham radio. Hams with a Technician license can operate digital modes on the HF 10m band between 28.0 MHz and 28.3 MHz. Technicians can also operate digital modes on segments of the 6m (50.1 MHz-54.0 MHz), 2m (144.1-148.0 MHz), 1.25m (222.0-225.0 MHz), and 70cm (420-450 MHz) band and on higher frequencies. Outside of a contest, digital mode operators tend to congregate around specific frequencies. Modes There are many different digital modes. In many cases, the operator needs a different software program to run each one. [FT8]/[FT4] Nobel Prize winning physicist and ham, Joe Taylor K1JT and colleagues have taken algorithms used to study pulsars to create several digital communication modes for hams that work under weak signal conditions. The most widely used of these modes is [FT8]. Taylor and his colleagues have also created and released a free software program to support these modes called WSTJ-X that runs on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

Actually, ham radio may have more lingo, jargon, and acronyms than most hobbies. But fear not. Learning to talk the talk is part of what makes joining a new community fun. And with ham radio, communicating (in one form or another) is the main point. As an international hobby with a 100+ year history, learning how to ‘speak ham’ is one of the best ways to join our community. By the way, it is ham radio not HAM radio. Ham is not an abbreviation for something. Also, some new folks might say, “I’m interested in ham; or I’m thinking about getting into HAM.” That sounds like they are interested in an edible pork product, not our glorious hobby. Most hams are forgiving people who want newcomers to join our ranks. But saying certain things is like writing a scarlet H in the middle of your forehead. Phonetic alphabet Amateurs across the globe have agreed on a standard phonetic alphabet–a way of spelling out callsigns and words that makes them more easily understood when propagation might not be ideal. The phonetic alphabet is often used on HF, but rarely on VHF or UHF FM. That’s because signals on VHF or UHF FM are often heard through repeaters and are usually very readable. So, if you’re transmitting on VHF or UHF through a repeater, you don’t need to use the phonetic alphabet. Some hams use different phonetic equivalents from the ones below, like “Wacko Three Tiny Microphone” for W3TM. As a rule of thumb, it’s better practice and the more common custom to use the standard phonetic alphabet. Sometimes under difficult operating conditions, like a busy contest, you might say “Whiskey Three TEXAS MASSACHUSETTS” or something unusual rather than “Whiskey Three Tango Mike”–if the other operator can’t quite copy the last part of your callsign after you’ve tried the standard phonetics several times.

The station apparatus must be under the physical control of a person named in an amateur station license grant on the ULS consolidated license database or a person authorized for alien reciprocal operation by § 97.107 of this part, before the station may transmit on any amateur service frequency from any place that is: Within 50 km of the Earth’s surface and at a place where the amateur service is regulated by the FCC; Within 50 km of the Earth’s surface and aboard any vessel or craft that is documented or registered in the United States; or More than 50 km above the Earth’s surface aboard any craft that is documented or registered in the United States. The types of station license grants are: An operator/primary station license grant. One, but only one, operator/primary station license grant may be held by any one person. The primary station license is granted together with the amateur operator license. Except for a representative of a foreign government, any person who qualifies by examination is eligible to apply for an operator/primary station license grant. A club station license grant. A club station license grant may be held only by the person who is the license trustee designated by an officer of the club. The trustee must be a person who holds an operator/primary station license grant. The club must be composed of at least four persons and must have a name, a document of organization, management, and a primary purpose devoted to amateur service activities consistent with this part. A military recreation station license grant. A military recreation station license grant may be held only by the person who is the license custodian designated by the official in charge of the United States military recreational premises where the station is situated. The person must not be a representative of a foreign government. The person need not hold an amateur operator license grant. The person named in the station license grant or who is authorized for alien reciprocal operation by § 97.107 of this part may use, in accordance with the applicable rules of this part, the transmitting apparatus under the physical control of the person at places where the amateur service is regulated by the FCC. A CEPT radio-amateur license is issued to the person by the country of which the person is a citizen. The person must not: Be a resident alien or citizen of the United States, regardless of any other citizenship also held; Hold an FCC-issued amateur operator license nor reciprocal permit for alien amateur licensee; Be a prior amateur service licensee whose FCC-issued license was revoked, suspended for less than the balance of the license term and the suspension is still in effect, suspended for the balance of the license term and relicensing has not taken place, or surrendered for cancellation following notice of revocation, suspension or monetary forfeiture proceedings; or Be the subject of a cease and desist order that relates to amateur service operation and which is still in effect.

When transmitting, each amateur station must have a control operator. The control operator must be a person: For whom an amateur operator/primary station license grant appears on the ULS consolidated licensee database, or Who is authorized for alien reciprocal operation by § 97.107 of this part. [63 FR 68978, Dec. 14, 1998] § 97.9 Operator license grant. The classes of amateur operator license grants are: Novice, Technician, General, Advanced, and Amateur Extra. The person named in the operator license grant is authorized to be the control operator of an amateur station with the privileges authorized to the operator class specified on the license grant. The person named in an operator license grant of Novice, Technician, General or Advanced Class, who has properly submitted to the administering VEs a FCC Form 605 document requesting examination for an operator license grant of a higher class, and who holds a CSCE indicating that the person has completed the necessary examinations within the previous 365 days, is authorized to exercise the rights and privileges of the higher operator class until final disposition of the application or until 365 days following the passing of the examination, whichever comes first. [75 FR 78169, Dec. 15, 2010] § 97.11 Stations aboard ships or aircraft. The installation and operation of an amateur station on a ship or aircraft must be approved by the master of the ship or pilot in command of the aircraft. The station must be separate from and independent of all other radio apparatus installed on the ship or aircraft, except a common antenna may be shared with a voluntary ship radio installation. The station’s transmissions must not cause interference to any other apparatus installed on the ship or aircraft. The station must not constitute a hazard to the safety of life or property. For a station aboard an aircraft, the apparatus shall not be operated while the aircraft is operating under Instrument Flight Rules, as defined by the FAA, unless the station has been found to comply with all applicable FAA Rules. § 97.13 Restrictions on station location. Before placing an amateur station on land of environmental importance or that is significant in American history, architecture or culture, the licensee may be required to take certain actions prescribed by §§ 1.1305–1.1319 of this chapter. A station within 1600 m (1 mile) of an FCC monitoring facility must protect that facility from harmful interference. Failure to do so could result in imposition of operating restrictions upon the amateur station pursuant to § 97.121. Geographical coordinates of the facilities that require protection are listed in § 0.121(c) of this chapter. Before causing or allowing an amateur station to transmit from any place where the operation of the station could cause human exposure to RF electromagnetic field levels in excess of those allowed under § 1.1310 of this chapter, the licensee is required to take certain actions. The licensee shall ensure compliance with the Commission’s radio frequency exposure requirements in §§ 1.1307(b), 2.1091, and 2.1093 of this chapter, where applicable. In lieu of evaluation with the general population/uncontrolled exposure limits, amateur licensees may evaluate their operation with respect to members of his or her immediate household using the occupational/controlled exposure limits in § 1.1310, provided appropriate training and information has been accessed by the amateur licensee and members of his/her household. RF exposure of other nearby persons who are not members of the amateur licensee’s household must be evaluated with respect to the general population/uncontrolled exposure limits. Appropriate methodologies and guidance for evaluating amateur radio service operation is described in the Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) Bulletin 65, Supplement B. If the routine environmental evaluation indicates that the RF electromagnetic fields could exceed the limits contained in § 1.1310 of this chapter in accessible areas, the licensee must take action to prevent human exposure to such RF electromagnetic fields. Further information on evaluating compliance with these limits can be found in the FCC’s OET Bulletin Number 65, “Evaluating Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields.” [54 FR 25857, June 20, 1989, as amended at 55 FR 20398, May 16, 1990; 61 FR 41019, Aug. 7, 1996; 62 FR 47963, Sept. 12, 1997; 62 FR 49557, Sept. 22, 1997; 62 FR 61448, Nov. 18, 1997; 63 FR 68978, Dec. 14, 1998; 65 FR 6549, Feb. 10, 2000; 80 FR 53752, Sept. 8, 2015; 85 FR 18151, Apr. 1, 2020] § 97.15 Station antenna structures. Owners of certain antenna structures more than 60.96 meters (200 feet) above ground level at the site or located near or at a public use airport must notify the Federal Aviation Administration and register with the Commission as required by part 17 of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided herein, a station antenna structure may be erected at heights and dimensions sufficient to accommodate amateur service communications. (State and local regulation of a station antenna structure must not preclude amateur service communications. Rather, it must reasonably accommodate such communications and must constitute the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish the state or local authority’s legitimate purpose. See PRB–1, 101 FCC 2d 952 (1985) for details.) Antennas used to transmit in the 2200 m and 630 m bands must not exceed 60 meters in height above ground level. [64 FR 53242, Oct. 1, 1999, as amended at 82 FR 27214, June 14, 2017] § 97.17 Application for new license grant. Any qualified person is eligible to apply for a new operator/primary station, club station or military recreation station license grant. No new license grant will be issued for a Novice or Advanced Class operator/primary station. Each application for a new amateur service license grant must be filed with the FCC as follows: Each candidate for an amateur radio operator license which requires the applicant to pass one or more examination elements must present the administering VEs with all information required by the rules prior to the examination. The VEs may collect all necessary information in any manner of their choosing, including creating their own forms. For a new club or military recreation station license grant, each applicant must present all information required by the rules to an amateur radio organization having tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that provides voluntary, uncompensated and unreimbursed services in providing club and military recreation station call signs (“Club Station Call Sign Administrator”) who must submit the information to the FCC in an electronic batch file. The Club Station Call Sign Administrator may collect the information required by these rules in any manner of their choosing, including creating their own forms. The Club Station Call Sign Administrator must retain the applicants information for at least 15 months and make it available to the FCC upon request. The FCC will issue public announcements listing the qualified organizations that have completed a pilot autogrant batch filing project and are authorized to serve as a Club Station Call Sign Administrator. No person shall obtain or attempt to obtain, or assist another person to obtain or attempt to obtain, an amateur service license grant by fraudulent means. One unique call sign will be shown on the license grant of each new primary, club and military recreation station. The call sign will be selected by the sequential call sign system. Effective February 14, 2011, no club station license grants will be issued to a licensee who is shown as the license trustee on an existing club station license grant. [63 FR 68978, Dec. 14, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 53242, Oct. 1, 1999; 65 FR 6549, Feb. 10, 2000; 75 FR 78170, Dec. 15, 2010] § 97.19 Application for a vanity call sign. The person named in an operator/primary station license grant or in a club station license grant is eligible to make application for modification of the license grant, or the renewal thereof, to show a call sign selected by the vanity call sign system. Effective February 14, 2011, the person named in a club station license grant that shows on the license a call sign that was selected by a trustee is not eligible for an additional vanity call sign. (The person named in a club station license grant that shows on the license a call sign that was selected by a trustee is eligible for a vanity call sign for his or her operator/primary station license grant on the same basis as any other person who holds an operator/primary station license grant.) Military recreation stations are not eligible for a vanity call sign. Each application for a modification of an operator/primary or club station license grant, or the renewal thereof, to show a call sign selected by the vanity call sign system must be filed in accordance with § 1.913 of this chapter. Unassigned call signs are available to the vanity call sign system with the following exceptions: A call sign shown on an expired license grant is not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the expiration of the license. A call sign shown on a surrendered or canceled license grant (except for a license grant that is canceled pursuant to § 97.31) is not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the date such action is taken. (The availability of a call sign shown on a license canceled pursuant to § 97.31 is governed by paragraph (c)(3) of this section.) This 2-year period does not apply to any license grant pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section that is surrendered, canceled, revoked, voided, or set aside because the grantee acknowledged or the Commission determined that the grantee was not eligible for the exception. In such a case, the call sign is not available to the vanity call sign system for 30 days following the date such action is taken, or for the period for which the call sign would not have been available to the vanity call sign system pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2) or (3) of this section but for the intervening grant to the ineligible applicant, whichever is later. An applicant to whose operator/primary station license grant, or club station license grant for which the applicant is the trustee, the call sign was previously assigned is exempt from the 2-year period set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A call sign shown on a license canceled pursuant to § 97.31 of this part is not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the person’s death, or for 2 years following the expiration of the license grant, whichever is sooner. If, however, a license is canceled more than 2 years after the licensee’s death (or within 30 days before the second anniversary of the licensee’s death), the call sign is not available to the vanity call sign system for 30 days following the date such action is taken. The following applicants are exempt from this 2-year period: An applicant to whose operator/primary station license grant, or club station license grant for which the applicant is the trustee, the call sign was previously assigned; or An applicant who is the spouse, child, grandchild, stepchild, parent, grandparent, stepparent, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or in-law of the person now deceased or of any other deceased former holder of the call sign, provided that the vanity call sign requested by the applicant is from the group of call signs corresponding to the same or lower class of operator license held by the applicant as designated in the sequential call sign system; or An applicant who is a club station license trustee acting with a written statement of consent signed by either the licensee ante mortem but who is now deceased, or by at least one relative as listed in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, of the person now deceased or of any other deceased former holder of the call sign, provided that the deceased former holder was a member of the club during his or her life. The vanity call sign requested by an applicant must be selected from the group of call signs corresponding to the same or lower class of operator license held by the applicant as designated in the sequential call sign system. The applicant must request that the call sign shown on the license grant be vacated and provide a list of up to 25 call signs in order of preference. In the event that the Commission receives more than one application requesting a vanity call sign from an applicant on the same receipt day, the Commission will process only the first such application entered into the Universal Licensing System. Subsequent vanity call sign applications from that applicant with the same receipt date will not be accepted. The first assignable call sign from the applicant’s list will be shown on the license grant. When none of those call signs are assignable, the call sign vacated by the applicant will be shown on the license grant. Vanity call signs will be selected from those call signs assignable at the time the application is processed by the FCC. A call sign designated under the sequential call sign system for Alaska, Hawaii, Caribbean Insular Areas, and Pacific Insular areas will be assigned only to a primary or club station whose licensee’s mailing address is in the corresponding state, commonwealth, or island. This limitation does not apply to an applicant for the call sign as the spouse, child, grandchild, stepchild, parent, grandparent, stepparent, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or in-law, of the former holder now deceased.

The Club Station Call Sign Administrator must retain the collected information for at least 15 months and make it available to the FCC upon request. A Club Station Call Sign Administrator shall not file with the Commission any application to modify a club station license grant that was submitted by a person other than the trustee as shown on the license grant, except an application to change the club station license trustee. An application to modify a club station license grant to change the license trustee name must be submitted to a Club Station Call Sign Administrator and must be signed by an officer of the club. May apply to the FCC for a modification of the operator/primary station license grant to show a higher operator class. Applicants must present the administering VEs with all information required by the rules prior to the examination. The VEs may collect all necessary information in any manner of their choosing, including creating their own forms. May apply to the FCC for renewal of the license grant for another term in accordance with §§ 1.913 and 1.949 of this chapter. Application for renewal of a Technician Plus Class operator/primary station license will be processed as an application for renewal of a Technician Class operator/primary station license. For a station license grant showing a call sign obtained through the vanity call sign system, the application must be filed in accordance with § 97.19 of this part in order to have the vanity call sign reassigned to the station. For a primary station license grant showing a call sign obtained through the sequential call sign system, and for a primary station license grant showing a call sign obtained through the vanity call sign system but whose grantee does not want to have the vanity call sign reassigned to the station, the application must be filed with the FCC in accordance with § 1.913 of this chapter. When the application has been received by the FCC on or before the license expiration date, the license operating authority is continued until the final disposition of the application.

Each license grant must show the grantee’s correct name, mailing address, and email address. The email address must be an address where the grantee can receive electronic correspondence. Revocation of the station license or suspension of the operator license may result when correspondence from the FCC is returned as undeliverable because the grantee failed to provide the correct email address. [85 FR 85533, Dec. 29, 2020] § 97.25 License term. An amateur service license is normally granted for a 10-year term. [63 FR 68979, Dec. 14, 1998] 9.0.1 § 97.27 FCC modification of station license grant. The FCC may modify a station license grant, either for a limited time or for the duration of the term thereof, if it determines: That such action will promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity; or That such action will promote fuller compliance with the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or of any treaty ratified by the United States. When the FCC makes such a determination, it will issue an order of modification. The order will not become final until the licensee is notified in writing of the proposed action and the grounds and reasons therefor. The licensee will be given reasonable opportunity of no less than 30 days to protest the modification; except that, where safety of life or property is involved, a shorter period of notice may be provided. Any protest by a licensee of an FCC order of modification will be handled in accordance with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. 316.

A person may request cancellation of an operator/primary station license grant on account of the licensee’s death by submitting a signed request that includes a death certificate, obituary, or Social Security Death Index data that shows the person named in the operator/primary station license grant has died. Such a request may be submitted as a pleading associated with the deceased licensee’s license. See § 1.45 of this chapter. In addition, the Commission may cancel an operator/primary station license grant if it becomes aware of the grantee’s death through other means. No action will be taken during the last thirty days of the post-expiration grace period (see § 97.21(b)) on a request to cancel a license due to the licensee’s death. A license that is canceled due to the licensee’s death is canceled as of the date of the licensee’s death. [75 FR 78171, Dec. 15, 2010] Subpart B—Station Operation Standards § 97.101 General standards. In all respects not specifically covered by FCC Rules each amateur station must be operated in accordance with good engineering and good amateur practice. Each station licensee and each control operator must cooperate in selecting transmitting channels and in making the most effective use of the amateur service frequencies. No frequency will be assigned for the exclusive use of any station. At all times and on all frequencies, each control operator must give priority to stations providing emergency communications, except to stations transmitting communications for training drills and tests in RACES. No amateur operator shall willfully or maliciously interfere with or cause interference to any radio communication or signal. § 97.103 Station licensee responsibilities. The station licensee is responsible for the proper operation of the station in accordance with the FCC Rules. When the control operator is a different amateur operator than the station licensee, both persons are equally responsible for proper operation of the station. The station licensee must designate the station control operator. The FCC will presume that the station licensee is also the control operator, unless documentation to the contrary is in the station records. The station licensee must make the station and the station records available for inspection upon request by an FCC representative. [54 FR 25857, June 20, 1989, as amended at 71 FR 66462, Nov. 15, 2006; 75 FR 27201, May 14, 2010] § 97.105 Control operator duties. The control operator must ensure the immediate proper operation of the station, regardless of the type of control. A station may only be operated in the manner and to the extent permitted by the privileges authorized for the class of operator license held by the control operator. § 97.107 Reciprocal operating authority. A non-citizen of the United States (“alien”) holding an amateur service authorization granted by the alien’s government is authorized to be the control operator of an amateur station located at places where the amateur service is regulated by the FCC, provided there is in effect a multilateral or bilateral reciprocal operating arrangement, to which the United States and the alien’s government are parties, for amateur service operation on a reciprocal basis. The FCC will issue public announcements listing the countries with which the United States has such an arrangement. No citizen of the United States or person holding an FCC amateur operator/primary station license grant is eligible for the reciprocal operating authority granted by this section. The privileges granted to a control operator under this authorization are: For an amateur service license granted by the Government of Canada: The terms of the Convention Between the United States and Canada (TIAS No. 2508) Relating to the Operation by Citizens of Either Country of Certain Radio Equipment or Stations in the Other Country; The operating terms and conditions of the amateur service license issued by the Government of Canada; and The applicable rules of this part, but not to exceed the control operator privileges of an FCC-granted Amateur Extra Class operator license. For an amateur service license granted by any country, other than Canada, with which the United States has a multilateral or bilateral agreement: The terms of the agreement between the alien’s government and the United States; The operating terms and conditions of the amateur service license granted by the alien’s government; The applicable rules of this part, but not to exceed the control operator privileges of an FCC-granted Amateur Extra Class operator license; and At any time the FCC may, in its discretion, modify, suspend or cancel the reciprocal operating authority granted to any person by this section. [63 FR 68979, Dec. 14, 1998] § 97.109 Station control. Each amateur station must have at least one control point. When a station is being locally controlled, the control operator must be at the control point. Any station may be locally controlled. When a station is being remotely controlled, the control operator must be at the control point. Any station may be remotely controlled. When a station is being automatically controlled, the control operator need not be at the control point. Only stations specifically designated elsewhere in this part may be automatically controlled. Automatic control must cease upon notification by a Regional Director that the station is transmitting improperly or causing harmful interference to other stations. Automatic control must not be resumed without prior approval of the Regional Director.

[71 FR 25982, May 3, 2006] § 97.119 Station identification. Each amateur station, except a space station or telecommand station, must transmit its assigned call sign on its transmitting channel at the end of each communication, and at least every 10 minutes during a communication, for the purpose of clearly making the source of the transmissions from the station known to those receiving the transmissions. No station may transmit unidentified communications or signals, or transmit as the station call sign, any call sign not authorized to the station. The call sign must be transmitted with an emission authorized for the transmitting channel in one of the following ways: By a CW emission. When keyed by an automatic device used only for identification, the speed must not exceed 20 words per minute; By a phone emission in the English language. Use of a phonetic alphabet as an aid for correct station identification is encouraged; By a RTTY emission using a specified digital code when all or part of the communications are transmitted by a RTTY or data emission; By an image emission conforming to the applicable transmission standards, either color or monochrome, of § 73.682(a) of the FCC Rules when all or part of the communications are transmitted in the same image emission One or more indicators may be included with the call sign. Each indicator must be separated from the call sign by the slant mark (/) or by any suitable word that denotes the slant mark. If an indicator is self-assigned, it must be included before, after, or both before and after, the call sign. No self-assigned indicator may conflict with any other indicator specified by the FCC Rules or with any prefix assigned to another country. When transmitting in conjunction with an event of special significance, a station may substitute for its assigned call sign a special event call sign as shown for that station for that period of time on the common data base coordinated, maintained and disseminated by the special event call sign data base coordinators. Additionally, the station must transmit its assigned call sign at least once per hour during such transmissions. When the operator license class held by the control operator exceeds that of the station licensee, an indicator consisting of the call sign assigned to the control operator’s station must be included after the call sign. When the control operator is a person who is exercising the rights and privileges authorized by § 97.9(b) of this part, an indicator must be included after the call sign as follows: For a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice Class to Technical Class: KT; For a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice or Technician to General Class: AG; For a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice, Technician, General, or Advanced Class to Amateur Extra Class: AE. When the station is transmitting under the authority of § 97.107 of this part, an indicator consisting of the appropriate letter-numeral designating the station location must be included before the call sign that was issued to the station by the country granting the license. For an amateur service license granted by the Government of Canada, however, the indicator must be included after the call sign. At least once during each intercommunication, the identification announcement must include the geographical location as nearly as possible by city and state, commonwealth or possession.

A space station may automatically retransmit the radio signals of Earth stations and other space stations. A space station may transmit one-way communications. Space telemetry transmissions may consist of specially coded messages intended to facilitate communications or related to the function of the spacecraft. The license grantee of each space station must make the following written notifications to the International Bureau, FCC, Washington, DC 20554. A pre-space notification within 30 days after the date of launch vehicle determination, but no later than 90 days before integration of the space station into the launch vehicle. The notification must be in accordance with the provisions of Articles 9 and 11 of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations and must specify the information required by Appendix 4 and Resolution No. 642 of the ITU Radio Regulations. The notification must also include a description of the design and operational strategies that the space station will use to mitigate orbital debris, including the following information: A statement that the space station operator has assessed and limited the amount of debris released in a planned manner during normal operations. Where applicable, this statement must include an orbital debris mitigation disclosure for any separate deployment devices, distinct from the space station launch vehicle, that may become a source of orbital debris; A statement indicating whether the space station operator has assessed and limited the probability that the space station(s) will become a source of debris by collision with small debris or meteoroids that would cause loss of control and prevent disposal. The statement must indicate whether this probability for an individual space station is 0.01 (1 in 100) or less, as calculated using the NASA Debris Assessment Software or a higher fidelity assessment tool; A statement that the space station operator has assessed and limited the probability, during and after completion of mission operations, of accidental explosions or of release of liquids that will persist in droplet form. This statement must include a demonstration that debris generation will not result from the conversion of energy sources on board the spacecraft into energy that fragments the spacecraft. Energy sources include chemical, pressure, and kinetic energy. This demonstration should address whether stored energy will be removed at the spacecraft’s end of life, by depleting residual fuel and leaving all fuel line valves open, venting any pressurized system, leaving all batteries in a permanent discharge state, and removing any remaining source of stored energy, or through other equivalent procedures specifically disclosed in the application; A statement that the space station operator has assessed and limited the probability of the space station(s) becoming a source of debris by collisions with large debris or other operational space stations. Where the application is for an NGSO space station or system, the following information must also be included: A demonstration that the space station operator has assessed and limited the probability of collision between any space station of the system and other large objects (10 cm or larger in diameter) during the total orbital lifetime of the space station, including any de-orbit phases, to less than 0.001 (1 in 1,000). The probability shall be calculated using the NASA Debris Assessment Software or a higher fidelity assessment tool. The collision risk may be assumed zero for a space station during any period in which the space station will be maneuvered effectively to avoid colliding with large objects. The statement must identify characteristics of the space station(s)’ orbits that may present a collision risk, including any planned and/or operational space stations in those orbits, and indicate what steps, if any, have been taken to coordinate with the other spacecraft or system, or what other measures the operator plans to use to avoid collision. If at any time during the space station(s)’ mission or de-orbit phase the space station(s) will transit through the orbits used by any inhabitable spacecraft, including the International Space Station, the statement must describe the design and operational strategies, if any, that will be used to minimize the risk of collision and avoid posing any operational constraints to the inhabitable spacecraft. The statement must disclose the accuracy, if any, with which orbital parameters will be maintained, including apogee, perigee, inclination, and the right ascension of the ascending node(s). In the event that a system is not be maintained to specific orbital tolerances, e.g., its propulsion system will not be used for orbital maintenance, that fact should be included in the debris mitigation disclosure. Such systems must also indicate the anticipated evolution over time of the orbit of the proposed satellite or satellites. All systems must describe the extent of satellite maneuverability, whether or not the space station design includes a propulsion system. The space station operator must certify that upon receipt of a space situational awareness conjunction warning, the operator will review and take all possible steps to assess the collision risk, and will mitigate the collision risk if necessary. As appropriate, steps to assess and mitigate the collision risk should include, but are not limited to: Contacting the operator of any active spacecraft involved in such a warning; sharing ephemeris data and other appropriate operational information with any such operator; and modifying space station attitude and/or operations. Where a space station requests the assignment of a geostationary orbit location, it must assess whether there are any known satellites located at, or reasonably expected to be located at, the requested orbital location, or assigned in the vicinity of that location, such that the station keeping volumes of the respective satellites might overlap or touch. If so, the statement must include a statement as to the identities of those parties and the measures that will be taken to prevent collisions. A statement addressing the trackability of the space station(s). Space station(s) operating in low-Earth orbit will be presumed trackable if each individual space station is 10 cm or larger in its smallest dimension, exclusive of deployable components. Where the application is for an NGSO space station or system, the statement shall also disclose the following: How the operator plans to identify the space station(s) following deployment and whether space station tracking will be active or passive; Whether, prior to deployment, the space station(s) will be registered with the 18th Space Control Squadron or successor entity; and The extent to which the space station operator plans to share information regarding initial deployment, ephemeris, and/or planned maneuvers with the 18th Space Control Squadron or successor entity, other entities that engage in space situational awareness or space traffic management functions, and/or other operators. A statement disclosing planned proximity operations, if any, and addressing debris generation that will or may result from the proposed operations, including any planned release of debris, the risk of accidental explosions, the risk of accidental collision, and measures taken to mitigate those risks. A statement detailing the disposal plans for the space station, including the quantity of fuel—if any—that will be reserved for disposal maneuvers. In addition, the following specific provisions apply: For geostationary orbit space stations, the statement must disclose the altitude selected for a disposal orbit and the calculations that are used in deriving the disposal altitude. For space stations terminating operations in an orbit in or passing through the low-Earth orbit region below 2,000 km altitude, the statement must disclose whether the spacecraft will be disposed of either through atmospheric re-entry, specifying if direct retrieval of the spacecraft will be used. The statement must also disclose the expected time in orbit for the space station following the completion of the mission. For space stations not covered by either paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(A) or (B) of this section, the statement must indicate whether disposal will involve use of a storage orbit or long-term atmospheric re-entry and rationale for the selected disposal plan. For all NGSO space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(B) or (C) of this section, the following additional specific provisions apply: The statement must include a demonstration that the probability of success of the chosen disposal method will be 0.9 or greater for any individual space station. For space station systems consisting of multiple space stations, the demonstration should include additional information regarding efforts to achieve a higher probability of success, with a goal, for large systems, of a probability of success for any individual space station of 0.99 or better. For space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(B) of this section that will be terminating operations in or passing through low-Earth orbit, successful disposal is defined as atmospheric re-entry of the spacecraft within 25 years or less following completion of the mission. For space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(C) of this section, successful disposal will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. If planned disposal is by atmospheric re-entry, the statement must also include: A disclosure indicating whether the atmospheric re-entry will be an uncontrolled re-entry or a controlled targeted reentry. An assessment as to whether portions of any individual spacecraft will survive atmospheric re-entry and impact the surface of the Earth with a kinetic energy in excess of 15 joules, and demonstration that the calculated casualty risk for an individual spacecraft using the NASA Debris Assessment Software or a higher fidelity assessment tool is less than 0.0001 (1 in 10,000). If any material item described in this notification changes before launch, a replacement pre-space notification shall be filed with the International Bureau no later than 90 days before integration of the space station into the launch vehicle. An in-space station notification is required no later than 7 days following initiation of space station transmissions. This notification must update the information contained in the pre-space notification. A post-space station notification is required no later than 3 months after termination of the space station transmissions. When termination of transmissions is ordered by the FCC, the notification is required no later than 24 hours after termination of transmissions.

The following paragraphs summarize the frequency sharing requirements that apply to amateur stations transmitting in the frequency bands specified in § 97.301 of this part. Each frequency band allocated to the amateur service is designated as either a secondary service or a primary service. A station in a secondary service must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations in a primary service. Where, in adjacent ITU Regions or sub-Regions, a band of frequencies is allocated to different services of the same category (i.e., primary or secondary services), the basic principle is the equality of right to operate. Accordingly, stations of each service in one Region or sub-Region must operate so as not to cause harmful interference to any service of the same or higher category in the other Regions or sub-Regions. Amateur stations transmitting in the 70 cm band, the 33 cm band, the 23 cm band, the 5 cm band, the 3 cm band, or the 24.05–24.25 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by the United States Government in the radiolocation service. Amateur stations transmitting in the 76–81 GHz segment, the 136–141 GHz segment, or the 241–248 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by the United States Government, the FCC, or other nations in the radiolocation service. Amateur stations transmitting in the 430–450 MHz segment, the 23 cm band, the 3.3–3.4 GHz segment, the 5.65–5.85 GHz segment, the 13 cm band, or the 24.05–24.25 GHz segment, must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by other nations in the radiolocation service. Amateur stations receiving in the 33 cm band, the 2400–2450 MHz segment, the 5.725–5.875 GHz segment, the 1.2 cm band, the 2.5 mm band, or the 244–246 GHz segment must accept interference from industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment. Amateur stations transmitting in the following segments must not cause harmful interference to radio astronomy stations: 76–81 GHz, 136–141 GHz, 241–248 GHz, 275–323 GHz, 327–371 GHz, 388–424 GHz, 426–442 GHz, 453–510 GHz, 623–711 GHz, 795–909 GHz, or 926–945 GHz. In addition, amateur stations transmitting in the following segments must not cause harmful interference to stations in the Earth exploration-satellite service (passive) or the space research service (passive): 275–286 GHz, 296–306 GHz, 313–356 GHz, 361–365 GHz, 369–392 GHz, 397–399 GHz, 409–411 GHz, 416–434 GHz, 439–467 GHz, 477–502 GHz, 523–527 GHz, 538–581 GHz, 611–630 GHz, 634–654 GHz, 657–692 GHz, 713–718 GHz, 729–733 GHz, 750–754 GHz, 771–776 GHz, 823–846 GHz, 850–854 GHz, 857–862 GHz, 866–882 GHz, 905–928 GHz, 951–956 GHz, 968–973 GHz and 985–990 GHz. In the 2200 m and 630 m bands: Amateur stations in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) and 472–479 kHz (630 m) bands shall only operate at fixed locations. Amateur stations shall not operate within a horizontal distance of one kilometer from a transmission line that conducts a power line carrier (PLC) signal in the 135.7–137.8 kHz or 472–479 kHz bands. Horizontal distance is measured from the station’s antenna to the closest point on the transmission line. Prior to commencement of operations in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) and/or 472–479 kHz (630 m) bands, amateur operators shall notify the Utilities Telecom Council (UTC) of their intent to operate by submitting their call signs, intended band or bands of operation, and the coordinates of their antenna’s fixed location. Amateur stations will be permitted to commence operations after the 30-day period unless UTC notifies the station that its fixed location is located within one kilometer of PLC systems operating in the same or overlapping frequencies. Amateur stations in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) band shall not cause harmful interference to, and shall accept interference from: Stations authorized by the United States Government in the fixed and maritime mobile services; Stations authorized by other nations in the fixed, maritime mobile, and radionavigation service. Amateur stations in the 472–479 kHz (630 m) band shall not cause harmful interference to, and shall accept interference from: Stations authorized by the FCC in the maritime mobile service; Stations authorized by other nations in the maritime mobile and aeronautical radionavigation services. Amateur stations causing harmful interference shall take all necessary measures to eliminate such interference—including temporary or permanent termination of transmissions. 60 m band: In the 5330.5–5406.4 kHz band (60 m band), amateur stations may transmit only on the five center frequencies specified in the table below. In order to meet this requirement, control operators of stations transmitting phone, data, and RTTY emissions (emission designators 2K80J3E, 2K80J2D, and 60H0J2B, respectively) may set the carrier frequency 1.5 kHz below the center frequency as specified in the table below. For CW emissions (emission designator 150HA1A), the carrier frequency is set to the center frequency. Amateur operators shall ensure that their emissions do not occupy more than 2.8 kHz centered on each of these center frequencies.

No amateur station transmission shall occupy more bandwidth than necessary for the information rate and emission type being transmitted, in accordance with good amateur practice. Emissions resulting from modulation must be confined to the band or segment available to the control operator. Emissions outside the necessary bandwidth must not cause splatter or keyclick interference to operations on adjacent frequencies. All spurious emissions from a station transmitter must be reduced to the greatest extent practicable. If any spurious emission, including chassis or power line radiation, causes harmful interference to the reception of another radio station, the licensee of the interfering amateur station is required to take steps to eliminate the interference, in accordance with good engineering practice. For transmitters installed after January 1, 2003, the mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency below 30 MHz must be at least 43 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission. For transmitters installed on or before January 1, 2003, the mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency below 30 MHz must not exceed 50 mW and must be at least 40 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission. For a transmitter of mean power less than 5 W installed on or before January 1, 2003, the attenuation must be at least 30 dB. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or first marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement. The mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency between 30–225 MHz must be at least 60 dB below the mean power of the fundamental. For a transmitter having a mean power of 25 W or less, the mean power of any spurious emission supplied to the antenna transmission line must not exceed 25 µW and must be at least 40 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission, but need not be reduced below the power of 10 µW. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or first marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement. The following standards and limitations apply to transmissions on the frequencies specified in § 97.305(c) of this part. No angle-modulated emission may have a modulation index greater than 1 at the highest modulation frequency. No non-phone emission shall exceed the bandwidth of a communications quality phone emission of the same modulation type. The total bandwidth of an independent sideband emission (having B as the first symbol), or a multiplexed image and phone emission, shall not exceed that of a communications quality A3E emission. Only a RTTY or data emission using a specified digital code listed in § 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol rate must not exceed 300 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the frequency shift between mark and space must not exceed 1 kHz. Only a RTTY or data emission using a specified digital code listed in § 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol rate must not exceed 1200 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the frequency shift between mark and space must not exceed 1 kHz. A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using a specified digital code listed in § 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol rate must not exceed 19.6 kilobauds. A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using an unspecified digital code under the limitations listed in § 97.309(b) of this part also may be transmitted. The authorized bandwidth is 20 kHz. A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using a specified digital code listed in § 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol rate must not exceed 56 kilobauds. A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using an unspecified digital code under the limitations listed in § 97.309(b) of this part also may be transmitted. The authorized bandwidth is 100 kHz. A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using a specified digital code listed in § 97.309(a) of this part or an unspecified digital code under the limitations listed in § 97.309(b) of this part may be transmitted. A RTTY or data emission having designators with A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J or R as the first symbol; 1, 2, 7, 9 or X as the second symbol; and D or W as the third symbol is also authorized. A station having a control operator holding a Novice or Technician Class operator license may only transmit a CW emission using the international Morse code. A station having a control operator holding a Novice Class operator license or a Technician Class operator license may only transmit a CW emission using the international Morse code or phone emissions J3E and R3E. Phone and image emissions may be transmitted only by stations located in ITU Regions 1 and 3, and by stations located within ITU Region 2 that are west of 130° West longitude or south of 20° North latitude. Emission F8E may be transmitted. A data emission using an unspecified digital code under the limitations listed in § 97.309(b) also may be transmitted. The authorized bandwidth is 100 kHz. In the 60 m band: A station may transmit only phone, RTTY, data, and CW emissions using the emission designators and any additional restrictions that are specified in the table below (except that the use of a narrower necessary bandwidth is permitted): Expand Table 60 M Band Emission Requirements Emission type Emission designator Restricted to: Phone 2K80J3E Upper sideband transmissions (USB).

Where authorized by §§ 97.305(c) and 97.307(f) of the part, an amateur station may transmit a RTTY or data emission using the following specified digital codes: The 5-unit, start-stop, International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2, code defined in ITU–T Recommendation F.1, Division C (commonly known as “Baudot”). The 7-unit code specified in ITU–R Recommendations M.476–5 and M.625–3 (commonly known as “AMTOR”). The 7-unit, International Alphabet No. 5, code defined in IT–-T Recommendation T.50 (commonly known as “ASCII”). An amateur station transmitting a RTTY or data emission using a digital code specified in this paragraph may use any technique whose technical characteristics have been documented publicly, such as CLOVER, G-TOR, or PacTOR, for the purpose of facilitating communications. Where authorized by §§ 97.305(c) and 97.307(f), a station may transmit a RTTY or data emission using an unspecified digital code, except to a station in a country with which the United States does not have an agreement permitting the code to be used. RTTY and data emissions using unspecified digital codes must not be transmitted for the purpose of obscuring the meaning of any communication. When deemed necessary by a Regional Director to assure compliance with the FCC Rules, a station must: Cease the transmission using the unspecified digital code; Restrict transmissions of any digital code to the extent instructed; Maintain a record, convertible to the original information, of all digital communications transmitted.

An amateur station must use the minimum transmitter power necessary to carry out the desired communications. No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 1.5 kW PEP. No station may transmit with a transmitter power output exceeding 200 W PEP: On the 10.10–10.15 MHz segment; On the 3.525–3.60 MHz, 7.025–7.125 MHz, 21.025–21.20 MHz, and 28.0–28.5 MHz segment when the control operator is a Novice Class operator or a Technician Class operator; or The 7.050-7.075 MHz segment when the station is within ITU Regions 1 or 3. No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 25 W PEP on the VHF 1.25 m band when the control operator is a Novice operator. No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 5 W PEP on the UHF 23 cm band when the control operator is a Novice operator. No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 50 W PEP on the UHF 70 cm band from an area specified in paragraph (a) of footnote US270 in § 2.106, unless expressly authorized by the FCC after mutual agreement, on a case-by-case basis, between the Regional Director of the applicable field facility and the military area frequency coordinator at the applicable military base. An Earth station or telecommand station, however, may transmit on the 435–438 MHz segment with a maximum of 611 W effective radiated power (1 kW equivalent isotropically radiated power) without the authorization otherwise required. The transmitting antenna elevation angle between the lower half-power (−3 dB relative to the peak or antenna bore sight) point and the horizon must always be greater than 10°. No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 50 W PEP on the 33 cm band from within 241 km of the boundaries of the White Sands Missile Range. Its boundaries are those portions of Texas and New Mexico bounded on the south by latitude 31°41′ North, on the east by longitude 104°11′ West, on the north by latitude 34°30′ North, and on the west by longitude 107°30′ West. No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 50 W PEP on the 219–220 MHz segment of the 1.25 m band. No station may transmit with an effective radiated power (ERP) exceeding 100 W PEP on the 60 m band. For the purpose of computing ERP, the transmitter PEP will be multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave dipole antenna. A half-wave dipole antenna will be presumed to have a gain of 1 (0 dBd). Licensees using other antennas must maintain in their station records either the antenna manufacturer’s data on the antenna gain or calculations of the antenna gain. No station may transmit with a transmitter output exceeding 10 W PEP when the station is transmitting a SS emission type. No station may transmit in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) band with a transmitter power exceeding 1.5 kW PEP or a radiated power exceeding 1 W EIRP. No station may transmit in the 472–479 kHz (630 m) band with a transmitter power exceeding 500 W PEP or a radiated power exceeding 5 W EIRP, except that in Alaska, stations located within 800 kilometers of the Russian Federation may not transmit with a radiated power exceeding 1 W EIRP. No station may transmit with a peak equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) exceeding 316 W in the 76–81 GHz (4 mm) band.
