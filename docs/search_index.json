You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Origins This book originated when a group of students expressed interest in a licensing class. 1.2 Philosophy Most hams agree that getting their “ticket” or license was the start of the journey, not the destination. In fact, for many hams, much of the material that must be mastered to pass one of the licensing exams only really makes sense in the specific context of operating. So, our philosophy with this book is to emphasize operating practices, and especially listening. In the U.S., you don’t need a license to listen, and even if you are an active operator, you’ll spend most of your time listening. Many hams started out as shortwave listeners (SWLs) back when the airwaves were full of shortwave stations that broadcasted programs in the ham bands or adjacent to ham bands. And listening to other hams operate is one of the best ways to learn what to do, and sometimes, what not to do. "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 2 Getting started 2.1 Don’t buy a radio (yet)", " Chapter 2 Getting started 2.1 Don’t buy a radio (yet) Many prospective hams buy a radio before they have a license. We suggest that you wait just a bit before buying a radio. Why? Well the often irresistible temptation is to buy the least expensive radio. Some inexpensive radios work well; others do not. By learning a bit more about ham radio, meeting other hams, and discussing the pros and cons of different radios, your decision to buy a radio can be a better-informed one. You might even find that a current ham is happy to let you borrow a radio while you learn and may even sell it to you at a very reasonable price. On the other hand, if you just can’t hold back, we recommend not spending a whole lot of money. It’s an open secret that hams realize early on is that radios have a way of asking for company. In other words, your first radio is unlikely to be your last or your only.

Actually, ham radio may have more lingo, jargon, and acronyms than most hobbies. But fear not. Learning to talk the talk is part of what makes joining a new community fun. And with ham radio, communicating (in one form or another) is the main point. As an international hobby with a 100+ year history, learning how to ‘speak ham’ is one of the best ways to join our community. 4.1 Acronyms A Amperes. A unit of electric current. AC Alternating current. AF Audio frequency. AM Amplitude modulation. AGC Automatic gain control. APRS Automatic Packet Reporting System. cm Centimeters. CW Continuous wave. CTCSS Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System. DC Direct current. DMR Digital mobile radio. DTMF Dual tone multi-frequency. FCC Federal Commmunications Commission. The U.S. Government agency charged with regulating radio communications. The FCC grants amateur radio operators licenses. FEMA Federal Emergency Management Agency. FET Field Effect Transistor. FM Frequency modulation. GHz Gigahertz. HF High frequency. A set of frequencies between 3 MHz and 30 [MHz.] The 80/75m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 15m, 17m, 15m, 12m, and 10m ham bands are HF bands. HF signals can propagate for long distances under common atmospheric conditions. ITU International Telecommunications Union. kHz Kilohertz. A unit of frequency. 1 kHz is 1 thousand cycles/sec. The ‘H’ is capitalized because it is named after Henrich Hertz. LED Light emitting diode. \\(LiFePO_4\\) Lithium Iron Phosphate. A type of rechargeable battery. LSB Lower sideband. m Meter or meters. mA Milliamperes. A unit of current. 1/1,000 of an Ampere (A). mF Microfarad. A unit of capacitance. 1/1,000,000 of a Farad. \\(\\mu F\\) is another abbreviation for microfarad using the Greek letter mu (\\(\\mu\\)). MHz Megahertz. A unit of frequency. 1 MHz is 1 million cycles/sec or 1 million Hertz (Hz). The ‘H’ is capitalized because it is named after Henrich Hertz. NCS Net control station. PTT Push to talk. RACES Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service. RF Radio frequency. RIT Receiver incremental tuning. SDR Software defined radio. SPDT Single pole double throw. A type of switch. SSB Single Sideband. SWL Shortwave listener. SWR Standing Wave Ratio. The ratio of forward power to reflected power. High SWR (&gt; 3:1 or more) means that the impedance of your antenna is a poor match to the impedance of your transmitter. This doesn’t matter very much for receiving signals, but it does pose a potential problem if you decide to transmit. V Volt or volts. A unit of electrical force. VFO Variable frequency oscillator. VHF Very high frequency. A set of frequencies between 30 and 300 MHz. The 6m, 2m, and 1.25cm bands are VHF bands. UHF Ultra-high frequency. A set of frequencies between 300 MHz and 3 GHz (3,000 MHz). The 70cm band is the most commonly used UHF ham band. ULS Universal Licensing System. USB Upper sideband. w Watts. A unit of power. 4.2 Abbreviations/variables CQ E Voltage. \\(E=IR\\) FT8/FT4 A digital mode of communication. I Current. \\(I=E/R\\) P Power. \\(P=IE=I^2R\\). Power is usually measured in watts (w) or some multiple of watts. R Resistance. \\(R=E/R\\).
